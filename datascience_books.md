# Veri Bilimi ( Data Science )

Wikipedia ya göre ; 

Veri Bilimi, yapılandırılmış veya yapılandırılmamış ya da çeşitli formlarda bulunnan verilerden, bilgiler, kavramlar veya anlayışlar çıkaran/ayıklayan  süreçler ve sistemleri  içeren disiplinlerarası bir alandır. Veritabanlarında bilgi keşfine(Knowledge Discovery in Databases: KDD) benzer şekilde. istatistik, veri madenciliği, tahmini analitiği gibi bazı veri analizi alanların  devamıdır.

Bu terim son yıllarda sıkça duyulmaya ve kullanılmaya başlanmıştır. Kısa bir tanım olarak Mustafa Acungil'in blogundaki yazı okunabilir ; http://mustafaacungil.blogspot.com.tr/2014/12/data-science-nedir.html.

Başka bir yazı da büyük veri, veri bilimi ve ontoloji üzerine http://devveri.com/big-data/buyuk-veri-veri-bilimi-ve-ontoloji de bulunan yazıdır.

Konu hakkında web de yer alan İstatistik, Matematik vb  bedava kitapların bazıları aşağıda görülmektedir.

Statistics

## Introduction to Statistical Learning

This is a highly recommended book for practicing data scientists. The focus of this books is kept on connecting statistics concept with machine learning. Hence, you’ll learn about all popular supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. R users will get an advantage, since the practical aspects of algorithms have been demonstrated using R. In addition to theory, this book also lay emphasis on using ML algorithms in real life setting.

## Elements of Statistical Learning

This book is an advanced level of previous book. It is written by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, Professors at Stanford University. Their first book ‘Introduction to Statistical Learning’ uncover the basics of statistics and machine learning. This book, will introduce you to higher level algorithms such as Neural Networks, Bagging & Boosting, Kernel methods etc. The algorithms have been implemented in R programming.

## Think Stats

The author of this book is Alien B Downey. It is based on perform statistical analysis practically in Python. Hence, make sure you’ve got some basic knowledge of Python before buying this book. It focuses entirely on understanding real life influence of statistics using popular case studies. Since, stats and math are closely connected, it also has dedicated chapters on topic like bayesian estimation.

## From Algorithms to Z Scores

Did you know the about crucial role of statistics in programming ? The author of this book is Norm Matloff, Professor, University of California. This book explains using probabilistic concepts and statistical measures in R. Again, a good practice source for R users. It teaches the art of dealing with probabilistic models and choosing the best one for final evaluation. It is a highly recommended book (specially for R users).

## Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

This is a highly recommended book for freshers in data science. The author of this book is William M Bolstad. It’s a must read for people who find mathematics boring. Having been written in a conversational style (rare to find math this way), this book is a great introductory resource on statistics. It begins with scientific methods of data gathering and end up delivering dedicated chapters on bayesian statistics.

## Discovering Statistics using R

This book is written by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles and Zoe Field. I would highly recommend this book to newbies in data science. To start with statistics, this book has a great content which goes in depth detail of its topics. Along with, the statistical concept are explained in conjunction with R which makes it even more useful. It offers a step by step understanding, with a parallel support of interesting practice examples.

## Mathematics
Introduction to Linear Algebra

This is one of the most recommended book on Linear Algebra. The author of this book is Gilbert Strang, Professor, MIT. Gilbert unique way of delivering knowledge would give you the intuition and excitement to move forward after every chapter. This book will help you to build a strong mathematical foundation for machine learning. It enlists all the necessary chapters such as vectors, linear equations, determinants, eigenvalues, matrix factorization etc in great depth.

## Matrix Computation

Matrix and Data frames are essential components of machine learning. The author of this book is Gene H Golub and Charles F Van Loan. This book provides a nice head start to students with concepts of matrix computations. The author covers most of the important topics such as gaussian elimination, matrix factorization, lancoz method, error analysis etc. Every chapter is supported by intuitive practice problems. The pseudo codes are available in Matlab.
